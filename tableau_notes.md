Fields are assigned to a dimensional (also known as categorical or qualitative) or measure (also known as numerical or quantitative) role.
Data levels of detail can range from granular (more detailed) to aggregated (combined).
You can select a mark in a visualization and right click to view the underlying data (if author enabled).
By default, measures are aggregated by sum
Workflow with Tableau:
* Connect to data
* Analyze the data
* Share your discoveries

Tableau has sample data sets installed with it
Tableau can work with Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, PDFs, spatial files, and statistical files
Tablea can connect to database servers, including relational databases, cube databases, and cloud data

Tableau fields can be hierarchical such as country, state, city
Dates in Tableau can be discrete or continuous
Tableau sometimes automatically generates fields as well such as number of records.
Converting to discrete and converting to a dimension are NOT synonymous.
Dimensions come out into the Tablea view as themselves, Measures come out as aggregates.
Measures show as gradient colors and dimensions show as a color palette. 

Visual analytics leverages our pre-attentive attributes, visual cues humans process automatically with sensory memory (such as light and dark colors, large and small shapes, groups and orientation of objects).
Mark is the term used to describe the visual representation of the data, such as a bar in a bar chart.
Line chart - best for viewing trends in data over time
bar chart - best for comparing data across categories
Heat Map - best for showing relationship between two factors
Tree Map - best for showing hierarchical data as proportion of whole
Gantt Chart - best for showing duration over time
Bullet Chart - best for evaluating performance of a metric against a goal
Scatterplot - best for investigating the relationship between quantitative values
Histogram - best for understanding distribution of the data
Box-and-whisker plot - best for showing distribution of a set of data

Saving a dashboard as a Tableau workbook (.twb file) saves the connection information but does not include a copy of the data source.
You have to save as a Tablea packaged work (.twbx file) to include the data source

Tablea can connect to data that falls within two categories: flat file data or server-based data
A live connection is a direct connection to the data while a data extract is a compressed snapshot of data stored locally and loaded into memory
You can connect to multiple data sources at a time.
You must have Creator permissions to publish a data source with Tableau Online
