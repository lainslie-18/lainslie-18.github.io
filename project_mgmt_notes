A project is a unique and temporary endeavor with a defined beginning and end and its purpose is to create a specific product or service or to make changes to a specific product or service.

Projects have constraints such as when they must be completed, budgets they have to stay within, etc.

The project manager oversees the success of the project but there are different ways the project team can be structured. 
In a Functional Organization, there is little to no project management as much of the coordination takes place between the functional departments where each manager of each group oversees their part of the project.

The three types of matrix organizations are weak, balanced, and strong. 

In a weak matrix, the functional manager is in charge and likely has the assistance of a coordinator who helps maintain the schedule and status and assists the functional manager but does not have any decision-making responsibility.

In the balanced matrix, the project manager and the functional manager both have some decision-making responsibility. The project manager manages the team to stay within scope, schedule, and budget while the functional manager makes decisions as to who does what work and how that work is to be accomplished.

In a strong matrix, the project manager has much more responsibility and authority but still does not make all the decisions.
